                <h2><strong>Defining the problem</strong></h2>
                <p>From co-founding
                an adult ESL program in my hometown to learning languages both inside and outside of classrooms, I’ve been excited and challenged by the language-learning space.
                It wasn’t until a conversation with my friend who was trying to pick up Korean that I really considered: How can we make it easier for students to learn a new language?
                </p>
                <p>To get a better understanding of the language-learning problem space, I interviewed six university students to determine:</p>


                <blockquote class="shadow-quote">
                    <p><small><strong>MOTIVATIONS AND NEEDS</strong></small></p>
                    <p>
                        1. Students value free resources and verbal communication. <br />
                        2. Students started learning a language in the first place because of
                        their cultural ties to the language.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>


                <blockquote class="shadow-quote">
                    <p><small><strong>PROBLEMS</strong></small></p>
                    <p> 1. It’s difficult to fit into their schedules. <br />
                        2. They lose motivation quickly. <br />
                        3. They don’t have access to feedback.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>I then turned the three problems into user tasks and created a modified morphological chart
                to determine the most effective means of achieving those tasks. I went forward with the highlighted potential solutions after sketching possible combinations.</p>

                                            <p>Duolingo has the most downloaded language app in the world, combining lessons and gamification
                                                to encourage users to learn a language. Duolingo also provides podcasts, events, and stories for a more well-rounded education.

                            in its time-reducing aspect while focusing on the <i>why</i> of learning a language: connecting to a culture through language
                            and verbal communication. Duolingo
                            and HelloTalk are amazing at providing
                            active vocabulary and grammar practice, and Cultura can supplement those resources by
                            fitting into the users’ existing lifestyles, minimizing the
                            time a person needs to set out of their day to learn.

                                                suggests the clarity of the design. I set the success threshold to <strong>92%</strong>

                                                quantitative measure to determine their opinions of the product.
                                                I set my benchmark NPS to be <strong>51.5</strong>, based on the <a href="http://static.duolingo.com/s3/DuolingoReport_Final.pdf" target="_blank">NPS</a> of another product in the same industry .</p>

                            The Net Promoter Score of 0 <strong>did not meet the benchmark of 51.5</strong>.
                            However, I was willing to continue with this design direction because of the other positive qualitative feedback
                            from the users. I realized during the testing sessions that the score of 0 could have been inflated as well,
                            since users may have felt
                            uncomfortable letting me know their true thoughts in person. It would also be
                            <a href="http://static.duolingo.com/s3/DuolingoReport_Final.pdf" target="_blank">difficult to predict</a> if the users
                            would continue using this product from this metric alone.
                            Next time, I would choose a more concrete metric for this situation and use the NPS in an anonymous setting or after the user has used
                            a product for a longer time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                         I gathered common feedback after calculating the success metrics to see if any insights could
                         contribute to those results: </p>

                         The insights showed that the design did not meet users’ expectations.
                         Next time, running through a quick heuristic evaluation before usability
                         testing will help me avoid making the same mistakes. The design also does not
                         consider ALL users — the biggest differentiating
                         factor between users was not the specific reasons for learning a language but the users’
                         level of expertise in the languages, which I did not account for.</p>

                    <h2><strong>Second iteration</strong></h2>

                    <p><a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/BXBbiYuPwe5wjETqAPD5Ah/Cultura-Prototype?scaling=scale-down&node-id=11%3A182" target="_blank" class="button">Prototype →</a></p>

                    I made several changes to address the main issues:</p>

                    <div class="py-3">
                    <h3><strong>1. The app functionality is unclear upfront</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                    The users expected an explanation of the app at the beginning or did not fully
                    understand the explanation on the sign up page, so I wanted to make it more clear
                    that the user would be able to listen to listen to episodes in a foreign language
                    and receive feedback on their recorded answers. Since I wanted to make the functionality
                    intuitive, I included a diagnostic quiz that mimics how the app works to give users a clear
                    expectation of how to use the app.</p>
                    <div class="container" style="background-color: black;">
                            <img src="img/cultura-start.gif" style="width:30%; margin: 50px auto;">
                            </div>


                    </div>

                    <div class="py-3">
                    <h3><strong>2. The app is not beginner-friendly</strong></h3>
                    <p>This point ties in with the first issue. I specified the unique experience for each user type (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
                    and how Cultura would accomodate for their levels. If the user knows that they are
                    a complete beginner, they can skip the test.</p>



                    <button class="accordion"><strong>See alternate design</strong> &nbsp; <small><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></small></button>
                    <div class="panel">
                      <p>I also considered the ability for users to self-identify their fluency levels instead of having a
                          quiz choose for them.
                          Although this option may take a shorter time, I decided to go with the quiz because it plays multiple roles—as well as giving the user an idea of how the app works, the diagnostic quiz would
                          excite the user as they anticipate a result. In case they want to change their level, they can
                          do so in Settings. This feature will be tested in following usability testing sessions!

                    Instead of having feedback from users, the feedback would now be from paid Cultura language experts.</p>

                    the amount of time each user was expected to spend in one sitting on the app, based on the usability testing sessions.</p>

                    <p>
                    Throughout the design process, I thought about how this product would function with business requirements.
                    How would this app fund itself? Because one main pillar of the app is accessibility, I did not
                    want this app to be paid. Implementing ads in users’ target languages would provide some learning
                    value to them while funding the product, making this usually intrusive advertisement component more pleasant.
                    However, could these ads be implemented if the user downloads all their lessons? I would
                    have to research more about the business aspect of products to determine if this method is feasible.</p> <br />

                    <p>
                    Are there any dangers in the way I designed this language learning experience?
                    Something that occurred to me as I was finishing up the second iteration is the behaviors that Cultura might encourage. If someone started learning a language because they were interested in a specific aspect
                    of a culture, would Cultura feed their interest and lead to a skewed view of that
                    culture and its people? Or would the benefits of language-learning
                    outweigh the cons significantly?
                    Considering the entire user/app relationship
                    during the beginning of the design process would have presented these possible long-term effects earlier on.</p> <br />

                    The second round of usability testing is in progress.</p>
                    <p>

                    Testing the success of the app would be difficult without creating a working prototype
                    because it is meant to be used over time. If I were to develop the app, these are some
                    KPIs I would use to gauge the product’s success, determined by engagement:</p>

                    <blockquote class="shadow-quote">
                            <p><small><strong>KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS</strong></small></p>
                            <p>
                    1. Episode completion rate<br />
                    Goal: 35%, based on
                    <a href="https://rainnews.com/the-download-on-podcasts-podcast-completion-rate-its-still-about-length/" target="_blank">the average length</a> of Cultura episodes (around 15 minutes).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                    2. Listen frequency<br />
                    Goal: 7 episodes per week,
                    <a href="https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/" target="_blank">based on the US average</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Feedback-to-listen ratio<br />
                    Goal: This data would be important to determine how useful the feedback feature is.
                    Because I couldn’t find a benchmark for this, I would likely do some testing to determine this number.<br />
                    </p></blockquote>

                    <p>After usability testing, I would implement those findings as well as the business and ethical considerations.</p>

                        From research to a high-fidelity prototype, this project
                    challenged me to practice UI principles and more:</p>

                <blockquote class="shadow-quote">
                    <p><strong>1. Sketch early.</strong> When I hit roadblocks, drawing out different design options
                        on paper helped me clearly and quickly visualize
                        which ones might work better than others.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>2. Collect more numbers.</strong> Even though I depended on metrics to validate my designs during usability
                        testing, I still found myself unsure of the results. This uncertainty came from one of my constraints—the small
                        sample size I gathered from my preliminary research. Having more data to analyze next time will give
                        me more confidence that the design is meeting users’ needs in the right way.
